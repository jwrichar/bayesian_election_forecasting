# Presidential Election Forecasting

This codebase was developed as part of an Intro to Bayesian Inference class in 2012. The purpose of the code was to forecast the state-by-state result of the 2012 US Presidential Election between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. The original code was developed in R using the JAGS package. Later, Python poll-scraping code was developed to forecast the 2016 and 2020 elections.

This codebase includes:

* Modeling code to forecast the election based on state-level polling data and past election results
* Utility code to scrape poll aggregation websites

## The Forecasting Model

The primary motivation for the model is from a 2010 paper from [Lock & Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/election15Feb.pdf). In a nutshell, the model:

1. Considers all state- and national-level polls, using a likelihood function that models the state-level poll outcomes with parameters for both the overall national trend and state-level offsets from that trend.
2. Automatically estimates and adjusts for any pollster-level bias.
3. Down-weights older polls compared to more recent ones (based on the empirical estimate from the Lock & Gelman paper).
4. Uses the most recent presidential election results as informative prior information about each stateâ€™s voting tendency.

The model fitting is performed with Markov Chain Monte Carlo routines from the `rjags` package.

## Instructions

### To pull the most recent polling data:

NOTE: RCP has changed its website dramatically for the 2024 cycle, breaking the poll scraping code. We now recommend that you use the option `data_source='538'`:

To pull all the polls for 2024, run the following in Python:

    from source.poll_scraper import load_and_write_all_polls
    load_and_write_all_polls(2024, data_source='538', local_data=False)

### To run a model:

Modify model parameters, such as the prediction year and MCMC settings in `source/constants.R`.

    cd source/
    R CMD BATCH jags_model.R
